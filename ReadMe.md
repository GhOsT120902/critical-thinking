## Project Overview
This project addresses the issue of **poor waste management on the K.R. Mangalam University (KRMU), Sohna campus**.  
Key campus observations revealed overflowing bins, scattered litter, lack of waste segregation, inconsistent collection schedules, and limited awareness among students.

Using structured critical thinking frameworks, the project investigates the problem deeply, identifies root causes, analyzes evidence, and proposes a practical, sustainable solution tailored to KRMU.

## Part A – Problem Identification & Bias Awareness
- Defined the central problem: *Inefficient waste management at KRMU*  
- Explained its significance for health, hygiene, environment, and campus experience  
- Identified cognitive biases:
  - Normalcy Bias  
  - Diffusion of Responsibility  
  - Optimism Bias  
  - Status Quo Bias  
- Provided real examples of how bias influences student and staff behaviour

## Part B – Evidence, Assumptions & Argument Analysis
Reviewed credible sources including studies from IIT Roorkee, MNIT Jaipur, educational waste-management reviews, and higher-education sustainability frameworks.

- Extracted assumptions from research (e.g., expected student cooperation, stable waste patterns)
- Analyzed strengths, limitations, and applicability to KRMU
- Found strong alignment between external evidence and campus conditions

### Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram  
Mapped causes under:
- People  
- Process  
- Environment  
- Materials  
- Infrastructure  
- Management  

### 5 Whys  
**Root Cause Identified:**  
*KRMU lacks a structured, coordinated waste-management system with proper monitoring and flexible collection.*

###  Six Thinking Hats  
Generated full-spectrum solutions, including:  
- Segregation stations  
- Smart-bin sensors  
- Vendor regulations (biodegradable packaging)  
- Composting unit  
- Behavioural nudges

##  Part D – Final Proposal & Implementation Plan

### Selected Best Solution  
A **Hybrid Waste-Management System** combining:
- Waste-segregation stations  
- IoT-based smart-bin alert system  
- Vendor packaging regulations  
- On-campus composting  
- Awareness & behaviour change programs  
- Monthly monitoring framework  

### Implementation Timeline  
**Phase 1:** Bin deployment + waste audit  
**Phase 2:** Smart sensors installation  
**Phase 3:** Vendor regulation rollout  
**Phase 4:** Composting setup  
**Phase 5:** Awareness programmes  
**Phase 6:** Monitoring & evaluation
